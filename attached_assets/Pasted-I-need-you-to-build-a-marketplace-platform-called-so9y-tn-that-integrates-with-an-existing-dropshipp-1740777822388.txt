I need you to build a marketplace platform called so9y.tn that integrates with an existing dropshipping platform called Shipper. Here’s how it should work:

1. Overview
so9y.tn is a marketplace that clones products from Shipper via API and lists them as retail products. When a customer makes a purchase, so9y.tn sends the order information to either:

Our internal customer service team for confirmation.
Or Sellmax, an external confirmation center.
After confirmation, so9y.tn sends the order to Shipper for fulfillment and delivery.

2. Users & Roles
Wholesale Suppliers (on Shipper) → Add their products with wholesale prices.
Dropshippers (like us) → Sell these products at a retail price and handle marketing.
Customers → Buy products on so9y.tn.
Customer Service Team → Confirms orders if we choose internal confirmation.
3. Features & API Integrations
Product Cloning & Management
Clone all products from Shipper using an API.
Allow editing of cloned products (titles, descriptions, prices, etc.).
Enable custom product creation (we can add products manually).
Order Processing & Confirmation
When a customer makes a purchase, send order details to:
Our internal customer service team or
Sellmax for confirmation.
After confirmation, send the order to Shipper for fulfillment.
Delivery & Tracking System
Generate a tracking code for each order.
Customers can track their orders step by step via a public tracking page.
SMS Notifications
Integrate with TunisieSMS API to send SMS notifications for each order update.
Show the tracking code on the Thank You page and send it via SMS.
4. Tech Stack & Requirements
Full-stack development (Front-end + Back-end).
API Integrations with:
Shipper (for product cloning & order fulfillment).
Sellmax (for order confirmation).
TunisieSMS (for SMS notifications).
Database to store product and order details.
Hosting setup for deployment.
5. Next Steps
Start by:

Writing a UML diagram to visualize the system.
Documenting APIs & database structure.
Building the back-end (handling product cloning, order processing, etc.).
Developing the front-end (marketplace UI).
